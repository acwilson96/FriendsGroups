## FriendGroups
Provided is a 2D Array of friendship relationships, where the (i,j) element indicates if Person i and Person j are friends.
A friends group consists of multiple friendships. If Person 0 is friends with Person 1, and Person 1 is friends with Person 2, then Person 0, 1, and 2 are all part of a single friends group. If Person 3 exists without any friendship ties to Person 0, 1, or 2, then Person 3 is in an independent friends group.
Puzzle is to solve to find out how many independent friends groups there are.
